PROXOMITY MEASURE

Android Smartphone customers are relying on Wi-Fi to carefully save the gigabytes available on their cell phone data plans. As per statistics in 2016 Compared to Cellular data, more than three times as much data consumed on Android mobile phones in the U.S. is delivered through Wi-Fi networks. Relying on Wi-Fi is something mobile carriers encourage, since they often direct subscribers to their own Wi-Fi hotspots to ease demand on their cellular data networks. And many places of business promote free Wi-Fi to get customers through the door. Our application for any mobile device finds the distance to the nearby access points. We are using Raspberry Pi as Wi-Fi Hotspot and the android device is connected to it and we aim to find the distance between both and display in the distance in android device.

MOTIVATION:
Extensive use of Wi-Fi compared to cellular data also to provide free and better service to android users by locating the Wi-Fi access point is the motivation behind our application Proximity Measure.

TECHNIQUES USED:
We have implemented the following 3 techniques:
•	Radio Fingerprinting
•	Modified FSPL
•	Lateration
